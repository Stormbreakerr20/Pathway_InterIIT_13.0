1. Asha Mehta, a 24-year-old college student, recently approached her lawyer with a devastating story. She alleges that she was raped by a man she trusted—a friend of a close family acquaintance. According to Asha, the incident occurred when she attended a small gathering at the acquaintance’s home. During the evening, she began feeling dizzy and disoriented after consuming a drink that the man offered her.

Asha recalls waking up hours later in a secluded room, partially undressed, and with clear signs that she had been assaulted. She immediately confronted the man, but he dismissed her accusations, claiming she was imagining things because she had "too much to drink."

Terrified and overwhelmed, Asha initially hesitated to tell anyone, fearing judgment and backlash. However, after confiding in a trusted friend, she decided to seek legal help. Asha is determined to press charges against the man for sexual assault, emphasizing that her state of vulnerability was exploited. She also wants the gathering’s host investigated to determine whether they knowingly allowed the assault to happen.

Asha hopes to pursue justice under laws protecting against sexual violence, aiming to hold her attacker accountable while safeguarding her dignity and privacy during the legal process.

2. Priya Sharma, a 19-year-old college freshman, came to her lawyer with a heart-wrenching dilemma. She recently discovered that she is six weeks pregnant, a result of a consensual relationship with her ex-boyfriend. However, Priya's circumstances are complicated—her family is extremely conservative, and she fears being disowned if they find out about her pregnancy. Moreover, she believes continuing the pregnancy would severely disrupt her education and future plans.

Priya wishes to have an abortion but is deeply concerned about the restrictive state laws governing abortion in her region. She claims that the clinic she consulted turned her away, stating that she requires parental consent and needs to fulfill other stringent requirements before the procedure can be approved.

Feeling trapped, Priya argues that the laws violate her right to make autonomous decisions about her body and future. She is seeking legal recourse to obtain permission for a safe abortion without involving her parents. Priya’s lawyer is preparing to challenge the state’s restrictive abortion laws, arguing that they are unconstitutional and disproportionately harm young women by denying them timely access to essential healthcare. Priya’s ultimate goal is to ensure that she can move forward without jeopardizing her safety, education, or personal aspirations.

3. Shivani Gupta, a software engineer, recently discovered that her employer, Zen Digital Pvt. Ltd., has been monitoring her personal phone activities without her explicit consent. The company installed tracking software on her work laptop, which allegedly accessed her phone data when connected to the laptop via Bluetooth or USB. Shivani claims this data includes her personal text messages, private photos, and social media activity. She argues that the company's actions have violated her right to privacy and caused significant mental distress. Zen Digital Pvt. Ltd., in its defense, states that the tracking software is part of its employee productivity monitoring policy, which is outlined in the company's terms of employment. However, Shivani asserts that she was not informed about the extent of the data being monitored or that her personal devices would be affected. Shivani is now seeking legal recourse under the right to privacy and relevant provisions of Indian law, including constitutional guarantees and any applicable penal sections regarding unauthorized access to private data.
