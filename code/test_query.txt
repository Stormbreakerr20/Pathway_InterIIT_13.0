input_case for RAG: Shivani Gupta, a software engineer, recently discovered that her employer, Zen Digital Pvt. Ltd., has been monitoring her personal phone activities without her explicit consent. The company installed tracking software on her work laptop, which allegedly accessed her phone data when connected to the laptop via Bluetooth or USB. Shivani claims this data includes her personal text messages, private photos, and social media activity. She argues that the company's actions have violated her right to privacy and caused significant mental distress. Zen Digital Pvt. Ltd., in its defense, states that the tracking software is part of its employee productivity monitoring policy, which is outlined in the company's terms of employment. However, Shivani asserts that she was not informed about the extent of the data being monitored or that her personal devices would be affected. Shivani is now seeking legal recourse under the right to privacy and relevant provisions of Indian law, including constitutional guarantees and any applicable penal sections regarding unauthorized access to private data.
